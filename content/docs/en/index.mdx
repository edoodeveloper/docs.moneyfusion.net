Once you create an application, an API link will be generated that can be implemented across multiple sites and applications.

<Callout type="warning" title="Mandatory Security Rules">

- The website URL must be valid and publicly accessible.
- The callback_url (optional). The redirect URL after payment, if provided, must belong to the main domain or an authorized subdomain.
- Only registered IP addresses will be allowed to access the API.
- Any undeclared IP will be automatically blocked.

</Callout>

<Callout type="idea" title="Practical Tip">

If you attempt a payment from an unauthorized IP, you will receive the following message:

**Unauthorized IP or unapproved application (xxx.198.xx.252)**

The IP shown in parentheses is **the one you must register** in your Fusion Pay application.

</Callout>

 </Step>
</Steps>
